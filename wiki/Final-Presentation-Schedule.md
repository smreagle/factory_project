## Final Presentation Schedule
Every CS 200 member of a team is required to attend the class when their team is presenting. Failing to attend your team's presentation will result in a 50% deduction in the presentation score.

Given that the MW room is not big enough for all the CS 200 and CS 201 students, you are only to come to class one day this week. That is the day your team is presenting.
